# Express server with Svalbard image :snowflake: :snowman: :ocean:

Simple Express.js server created as exercise for Kodilla webdeveloper bootcamp (Module 21.2).

## Technologies

* Express.js
* templating engine: express-handlebars
* nodemon (I have it installed globally, so it is not reflected in package.json dependencies)

## Installation

`yarn add` or `npm install`

## Running

Download/clone project and run `node server` in your console.

You can also install nodemon npm package and run `nodemon server`. This utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server. I have it installed globally, so it is not reflected in package.json dependencies.

## TODO's

- [ ] add new feature: if user load an image in contact form (as project design), as a result of succsess show img itself and not only info about success
